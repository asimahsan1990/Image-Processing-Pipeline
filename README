IMAGE PROCESSING WITH CONVOLUTION

<jeh.wicker@gmail.com>

This project performs pixel-by-pixel convolution on a 2-dimensional image of any height and width. A user-defined type pixel_t is a three-channel struct which is passed onto the data bus and through the decoder, blur, edges, emboss, flip, invert, and encoder modules. The only modules which perform operations are blur, edges, and emboss. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SIMULATION DEMO

Download and unpack this file on a machine equipped with Mentor Questa'

The 'input' folder should contain a color image and PrintPixels program.

The 'output' folder should contain only the ReconstructImage program.

Run ./run in the root directory. 

When the images appear, press any key to continue. 
When the simulator starts, enter 'run -all' at the prompt.

NOTES

Source code for the OpenCV programs is in the opencv folder. All SystemVerilog files are in the root directory.

Ongoing development will take place at
